This code is an adaptation of the codes demonstrated by  Reed et al. (2015), Foulkes (2016), Lima (2017) & Marees et al.(2018). The code runs a genome-wide association study on genomic and phenotype data. The GWA results are visualized in a Manhattan plot sorted to look for correlations that cross a Bonferroni corrected threshold or a less stringent suggestive association threshold.The code is designed to run one GWA analysis at a time and 
should not be used to analyze data from multiple populations parallel.
